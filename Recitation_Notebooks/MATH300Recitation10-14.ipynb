    "We'll start by doing an example of Muller's method, and wrap up Chapter 2 of the textbook on equation solving. We have seen several methods for root finding and compared them (on the basis of their assumptions, order of convergence, etc.), and seen implementations of them from scratch using Julia. However, in practice, people typically use packages to solve these sorts of problems instead of coding their own algorithm (if the problem is generic enough, that is). We'll see how to use some of Julia's ecosystem to solve our own problems and simplify larger-scale codebases that we may produce with our own projects."

How can we find the complex roots? Consider choosing the three initial points between, say, $-2$ and $0$. There, $f(x)$ is concave down and negative, so we should expect that the approximating parabola is concave down and always negative (i.e., there are no real roots of the approximating parabola). Then, we will have in the first iterate a complex approximation to the root. Following that iteration scheme will likely produce the complex root we desire to the desired accuracy (again, the last of the four roots will be given by the conjugate).\n",

    "Now we've wrapped up Chapter 2 and said some words about real world use of those concepts, so we'll move into Chapter 3. The chapter is about interpolation and polynomial approximation. The essence of \"why we care\" is that there are many scenarios in the real world where we have a discrete dataset of inputs and outputs and we would like to get a continuous (i.e., not discrete) function mapping that agrees completely on our dataset, and that we can then use to extract information not in the dataset (i.e., try to get the output of the mapping given an input we haven't seen before). This could be, for example, a dataset where we are given a city's population for a collection of years, and we would like to approximate the city's population at a year where there was no census taken (see problem 3.1.19).\n",

    "The reason why we choose polynomials to approximate with is really a combination of two things: the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, and the fact that calculus on polynomials is easy. The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem guarantees us that for well-behaved (i.e., continuous on a closed interval) functions, there exist sequences of polynomials that approximate the function to an arbitrary degree (within an arbitrary tolerance over the interval). Of course, the ease of calculus is self-explanatory; if we want to compute the integral of a \"hard\" function over some interval $[a, b]$, we can approximate it with a polynomial interpolant and take the integral of the interpolant (which can be done using linearity of integrals and power rule). This provides us with a way to integrate functions that don't have nice anti-derivatives (or any at all) as long as we can evaluate the function at a collection of nodes.\n",

For the degree one interpolant, $n = 1$, so we need the second derivative of $f$, which is $-\\cos(x)$. Maximizing the absolute value of this over $[0, 0.6]$, we get a bound of $1$.
